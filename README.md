Taste Around the World : Traveling Through Tasebuds 

We started as wanting to create an application where you can recreate national dishes from around the world. 
We wanted to share our love for food by showcasing recipes from different culture as well as allow individuals to add recipes to the site. 

This application uses a PERN stack. 

Patrick: Front End
-The front end was created with the following Languages, Frameworks, Libraries: Javascript, CSS, Html, React, -React-Router-Dom, Mui/Icons, and React-Bootstrap
-The front-end consists of the Home page, About page, Countries page, and National page.
-Bugs: Picture sizing isint completely linear when zooming in and out.

Whats not working: The front end and back end are not connected as of right now. 
What i could of done better: Made the UI a little cleaner with better color contrast.


Cassandra:BackEnd 
Established: 
-the ERD, 
-models, migrations, 
-compiled recipe data, 
-used sequelize fixtures to import my data from vsCode to PgAdmin, 
Issues:
-was able to connect the data to front end, but unable to to render that data directly onto the site. 
-didn't have time to import more recipe data 

Preston: BackEnd
-The backend consisted of the controller/routes and using those to connect directly and send JSON data to/from the database api and also to the frontend web pages. 
-Find all recipes, Find a specific recipe, create a new recipe, update a recipe, and delete a recipe. We used Postman to test the controllers.
